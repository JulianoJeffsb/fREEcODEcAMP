        The Carioca teacher Gustavo Guanabara always sought to create different classes within his classroom. When he discovered that he could teach thousands of people over the internet, he created his first PHP course in 2005. Since then, he has had more than 8 million downloads and has contributed to the education of many beginner programmers.

        In 2013, with the main support of Hostnet, Guanabara started the Curso em VÃ­deo (Video Course) project, and in 2017, he began the testing phase of the Estudonauta platform, which would bring new courses with the same quality.
